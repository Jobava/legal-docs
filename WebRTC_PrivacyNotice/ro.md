# Firefox Hello Privacy Notice

{: datetime="2014-11-25" }

We care about your privacy. When Hello sends information to Mozilla (that's us) our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we use that information.

## Things you should know:

When you make calls, the data below is sent to Mozilla in order to connect the call. Once connected, your communications are encrypted.  

* **Firefox Accounts**: Accounts are optional to use with Firefox Hello.  If you sign-in with a Firefox Account, your Firefox browser sends Mozilla your account name in order to direct calls to you. To learn more about how data is used by Firefox Accounts, click [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox-cloud/).

* **Contact Information**: You can import or add new contacts to create an address book with email addresses, profile pictures, and names of people you may call.  This contact information is stored locally on your device. When you use the Service, your Firefox browser encrypts your contact's information and sends it to us to connect calls.  If your call is through a conversation URL that you generate, we delete the contact information after 30 days but you can delete it sooner by revoking the conversation URL.  Otherwise, for direct calls, we delete this information once the call is finished.

* **Feedback & Support**: Sending feedback to Mozilla is optional.  You can provide us with information if you submit a crash report or a report on our support forum.

---------------------------------------

We automatically receive certain metrics from use of the Service.

* **Performance metrics**: We automatically receive performance and responsiveness data about calls and attempted calls in order to detect issues, diagnose them, and improve Firefox Hello.  For example, the data we receive includes quality for audio and video streams, whether calls failed or were disconnected, duration of the call, obfuscated IP addresses, obfuscated network and hardware data (e.g. if you are on a wifi or cellular network) and timestamps.

* **Usage metrics**: We receive data on how many people use the Service, types of operating systems and browsers, and countries in which the Service is used.  

* **Reports**: We share aggregate information on performance and usage metrics.

---------------------------------------

Firefox Hello is provided to you in collaboration with TokBox, Inc. ("TokBox") and sends data to TokBox as a part of the function of the service.  This notice only describes how Mozilla handles information we receive from you.
